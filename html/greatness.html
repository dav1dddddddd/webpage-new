        in august of 2024, i committed to exploring the sport of climbing through a membership, and to
        say the least, i've fallen in love with it. it's truly transformed me into a more disciplined and
        motivated individual ever since i started.
      </p>

      <p class="reveal">
        through steady and quick skill progression, i quickly became ambitious and decided i wanted to be not just good, but 
        <span>great</span>. like any other sport, my seemingly linear progression slowed just as quickly as it had
        climbed (unintentional pun). i realized my goal would take much more time, commitment, and sacrifice than i had ever
        expected. a google search and multiple reddit posts later, the internet would often tell me: 
      </p>

      <blockquote class="reveal">
        “you can't rush greatness.”
      </blockquote>

      <p class="reveal">
        but i hated this idea. who decided great things ultimately take time? why should improvement be a process of waiting?
      </p>

      <p class="reveal">
        and after much thought, i realized i wasn't bothered by the time itself — it was the feeling of being told to slow down.
        like my drive was something that made me naïve. and after even more time & thought, this conflict taught me something even more nuanced:
      </p>

      <p class="reveal">
        you really can't rush greatness — waiting is what strengthens you. the patience and discipline needed to listen to your body.
        it was never about softening ambition — it was about putting yourself in the position for greatness.
      </p>

      <p class="reveal">
        but you can't just settle.
        <br>you can't settle for "good enough".
        <br>you can't settle for giving up when things get hard.
        <br>you can't settle for what's easier or what's comfortable.
      </p>

      <p class="reveal">
        show up consistently. push when things get hard. rest when you need it. stay motivated. ambitious. driven by your goal.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="reveal">
        “you can't rush greatness — you can't settle for less.”
      </blockquote>

      <p class="reveal">that has a nicer ring to it.</p>
